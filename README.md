# TODO:

- [ ] Create a graph of solved questions over time. or some other stats for myself. I think this should have a home on my website
- [ ] Organise the problems by the tags of solution. This will help me come back to CP after some time away. Right now I don't remember every algorithm I used to remember. This can help me revisit the important bit very fast.
- [ ] Have a commentary (maybe AI generated, so can be wrong) on a solution of the problem. This combined with the tags of problem can become very helpful to remember stuff latter on.
- [ ] Better than the commentry, write the things you know about a problem on your webstie. For example, Binary search and ternary search. PBDS, etc. This is your own notes on how to do something.
- [ ] Link each contest to it's link, like every problem needs to be linked to the website.
- [ ] Remove unused macros or constants from the solution files. This will make it less bloated and easy to understand. Technically if I can have as minimal of templeting as possible, it will help.
- [ ] Solve CSES again to get back into the zone
- [ ] Investigate why the compile takes so much time
- [ ] Explore the cf-tool and get something simple like it
