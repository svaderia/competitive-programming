# TODO:

- [ ] Create a graph of solved questions over time. or some other stats for myself. I think this should have a home on my website
- [ ] Organise the problems by the tags of solution. This will help me come back to CP after some time away. Right now I don't remember every algorithm I used to remember. This can help me revisit the important bit very fast.
- [ ] Have a commentary (maybe AI generated, so can be wrong) on a solution of the problem. This combined with the tags of problem can become very helpful to remember stuff latter on.
- [ ] Link each contest to it's link, like every problem needs to be linked to the website.
- [ ] Remove unused macros or constants from the solution files. This will make it less bloated and easy to understand. Technically if I can have as minimal of templeting as possible, it will help.
